## Breast Cancer Detection using Neural Network

### Background
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improved outcomes. Traditional methods of diagnosis involve manual examination and imaging techniques, which can be time-consuming and may not always be accurate.

### Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using a neural network to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA).

### Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, available in the `sklearn.datasets` module, contains features computed from digitized images of FNA of breast masses. The dataset includes information such as the mean radius, mean texture, mean smoothness, and other features.

### Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: I loaded the dataset and converted it into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation. I then separated the features and the target variable (label) for training the model.

2. **Data Standardization**: To ensure that all features have the same scale, I used `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to standardize the data.

3. **Neural Network Model**: I constructed a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with ReLU activation, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

4. **Model Training**: I split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` and trained the model using the training data. I also used a validation split to monitor the model's performance during training.

5. **Model Evaluation**: After training the model, I evaluated its performance using the testing data and calculated the accuracy of the model.

6. **Prediction**: Finally, I made predictions on new data points using the trained model to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign.

### Results
The neural network model achieved an accuracy of `accuracy_score` on the test data, indicating that it can effectively classify breast cancer tumors.

### Future Improvements
- Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
- Explore other feature engineering techniques to enhance the model's ability to detect breast cancer.
- Incorporate other types of data, such as genetic information, to improve the accuracy of the model.

### Conclusion
In this project, I developed a neural network model for breast cancer detection using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database. The model showed promising results(upto 95 % accuracy) in classifying breast tumors as malignant or benign, highlighting the potential of machine learning in improving breast cancer diagnosis.
